# robot-4th-project-on-dash

this is the result of the 4th project on dah by general assembly.
I made use of html, css, classes, nest classes, position: top, left, z-index, transform: rotate, scaleY, Animation, keyframes blink.
And pick a random number with (Math.random() * 255) AND make it round (towards down) with Math.floor
Used toggleClass to add or remove an element such as dancer-img
Used keyframes to move around elements such dancer-img
